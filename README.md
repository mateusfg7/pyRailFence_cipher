# pyRailFence Cipher
A Python script to encode messages using the Rail Fence algorithm.

This script was made to study the many ways to encode a message described in [_The Code Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book), of [Simon Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh).

## Usage

main.py **-m [_message_]**

e.g.:
```bash
python main.py -m "mateus"

Message: mateus
Cipher: MTUAES

```
